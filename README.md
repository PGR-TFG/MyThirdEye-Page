## What is _My Third Eye_?
_My Third Eye_ is the resulting application of a Cordoba's university final degree project. Developed by:
- Student: Pablo García Ruiz.
- Tutor: [Manuel Jesús Marín Jiménez](https://github.com/mjmarin).

It's an app that provides **vision-based assistive functionalities** by means of machine vision and is intended to be used primarily by **people** who are **visually impaired**.

---
## Motivations
The motivations for the project are as follows:
- To create an application to help overcome visual impairment.
- Research into the needs of visually impaired people and the functionalities that can be used to meet them.
- Study of the tools needed to work with artificial vision in a mobile environment.
- Study and research into existing scene description techniques, among others, for their application in mobile environments with low computational resources.
- Experimentation in a real environment, with different iterations where the user experience is considered and improved.
